# My Stack

This is a list of the tools I use and how I use them in my dev env.

* Zellij - Better TMUX Replacement
* Starship - Grand Unified Prompt
* Gruvbox - Universal Warm Theme (until I find or make a better one)
* Zsh - Powerful configurable shell
* NVim - Modern VI
* Alacritty (to become WezTerm) - Blazingly Fast Terminal Emulator
