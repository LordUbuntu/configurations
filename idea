the process has been greatly simplified because previous renditions became unbearable to use.

Each distro has its own folder, in which is its own distro-specific install script including both automatic (package manager) and manual (wget, etc) instructions.

There is a single languages file that installs programs through language packaging tools (eg: buku, black, flake8 for python via pip)

There is a single sync script that hard links dotfiles with their paths in the user home.

There is a single setup script that configures different things in the environment (eg: git ssh key).

There is a single bootstrap script that sources/runs (in order):
- distro scripts
- language script
- sync script
- setup script

every file source must be done with the directory below it, so now ../ nonsense



This new system avoids the horrific cascade of fragmented scripts.
